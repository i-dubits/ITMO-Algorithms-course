# Week 2 problems

### Number of inversions

Find number of inversions in a array of integers. Number of array elements is n (1&le;n&le;10<sup>5</sup>). Array elements are less than 10<sup>9</sup>. 

*Hint:* fast solution should use the modification of Merge sort.

### Anti quicksort

Find permutation of numbers from 1 to n on which quicksort will perform the maximum number of comparisons. If there are several such permutations, output any of them (1&le;n&le;10<sup>6</sup>). Pivot element is chosen to be the middle element of the array.

### Is sorting possible?

For any i you can swap only i and (i+k)-th elements of the array. Number of array elements is n. Is it possible to sort it?
