# Week 8 Hash functions

### Modified associative array

Implement modified associative array that supports the following operations: 

- get the value by key
- delete the value by key
- output the value corresponding to the key that was added to the array after all keys, but before the key x  
- output the value corresponding to the key that was added to the array before all keys, but after the key x  
- change the value by key

Keys and values are strings the length of which does not exceed 20 characters. Number of operations N&le;5&sdot;10<sup>5</sup>.

*Time limit*: 3 seconds

*Memory limit:* 256 MB

*File:* `mod_array.cpp`

### Fast hash table

Implement hash table that is capable to store integers from interval [0; 10<sup>15</sup> - 1]. Hash table must support "add" operation and check if the element is in the table. Number of operations N&le;10<sup>7</sup>.

*Time limit*: 5 seconds

*Memory limit:* 256 MB

*File:* `hash_table.cpp`
